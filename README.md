# Rock Paper Scissors Game
 ""Rock Paper Scissors is a classic game of chance played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The three shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V). The winner is determined by the rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.

This project is a web-based implementation of the game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player can select their choice by clicking on the corresponding button, and the computer's choice is generated randomly. The result is displayed on the screen, along with the updated score and level. The game features four levels of difficulty, with the score threshold for each level increasing progressively. The player can track their progress by monitoring their score and level on the scoreboard.

This game is a fun way to pass the time and test your luck against the computer. Give it a try and see if you can beat the odds!"
